## The US Geological Survey (USGS) provides critical data on natural hazards, ecosystems, and climate change. They're developing new tools to better visualize earthquake data, aiming to inform the public and government organizations and secure funding for addressing global challenges.

### Create the Earthquake Visualization

1. The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the USGS GeoJSON FeedLinks to an external site. page and choose a dataset to visualize.
2. When you click a dataset (such as "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days"), you will be given a JSON representation of that data. Use the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for the visualization.
3. Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
4. Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
5. Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
6. Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
